### Hello!

I'm DUTHAHO, a developer out of Da Nang, Viet Nam. I've been in development for nearly ten years, having started off by hacking on gaming and than moving on to web development in the early 2018.

Now I'm working for [Paradox](https://paradox.ai). I also work on many open source projects in the language and was active in the community.

I have turned most of my focus to Python and JavaScript. I love working on the web in general, but lately have been mostly involved with Vue.js, the Django. 

If you want to find out more about me, check out my [blog](https://www.duthaho.com) or follow me on Facebook ([@DuongThanhHop](https://www.facebook.com/DuongThanhHop/)).
